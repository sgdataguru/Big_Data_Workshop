## Lab: SQL Practice

_Author: Mahesh_


### Required Preparation

In order to run SQL queries within Python/this Jupyter notebook, you will need to install the following:

```bash
conda install sqlalchemy
conda install psycopg2
```

If you get an error trying to install `psycopg2`, you can install a stand-alone package (sufficient for everything you'll need to complete this lab) by entering the following anywhere in the terminal: 

```bash 
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

(If `pip` doesn't work for you, try `pip3 install psycopg2-binary`.)


### Instructions

In this lab, you're going to have ten prompts. Each prompt will require you to do two things:
1. Write a SQL query.
2. Use the result of that query to answer the question.

The purpose of this lab is to get you to practice your SQL - an **important** skill in data science! While it is possible to get these answers using Pandas, it should be your goal to do everything only in SQL.

**Data**: The data used in this lab is the Iowa liquor database. It contains various tables of transactions. The schema for this database is here:

<img src="../images/schema.png" alt="schema" width="750"/>

```{python}
# Import Pandas and Create_Engine

import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Set up the engine to access the data.
engine = create_engine('postgresql://analytics_student:analyticsga@analyticsga-psql.generalassemb.ly:5432/iowa_liquor_sales_database')
```

### Prompt 1

How many rows are there in the `stores` table of the Iowa liquor database?

```{python}
# Use a SQL query to find the answer to the above prompt.

sql = """
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM stores;
"""

pd.read_sql_query(sql, engine)
```

**Prompt 1 Answer**: 1973


### Prompt 2

If you sort the stores in alphabetical order by name, which store is fourth?

```{python}
# Use a SQL query to find the answer to the above prompt.

sql = """
SELECT * 
FROM stores
ORDER BY name
LIMIT 4;
"""

pd.read_sql_query(sql, engine)
```

**Prompt 2 Answer**: 3061 Cub Foods / Sioux City.


### Prompt 3

Among those sales whose category name is `IMPORTED VODKA`, if you sort by vendor in alphabetical order, what is the bottle price and number of bottles bought in the first 3 transactions?
> You should give us three sets of numbers - one for each transaction.

```{python}
# Use a SQL query to find the answer to the above prompt.

sql = """
SELECT btl_price, bottle_qty
FROM sales
WHERE category_name = 'IMPORTED VODKA'
ORDER BY vendor ASC
LIMIT 3;
"""

pd.read_sql_query(sql, engine)
```

**Prompt 3 Answer**: 
- Transaction 1: bottle price is \$8.99 and 12 bottles purchased.
- Transaction 2: bottle price is \$28.50 and 1 bottle purchased.
- Transaction 3: bottle price is \$28.50 and 6 bottles purchased.


### Prompt 4

What is the total amount of liquor sold in February 2015?

```{python}
# Use a SQL query to find the answer to the above prompt.

sql = """
SELECT SUM(total)
FROM sales
WHERE date BETWEEN '2-1-2015' AND '2-28-2015';
"""
pd.read_sql_query(sql, engine)
```

**Prompt 4 Answer**: The total amount of liquor sold in February 2015 is \$21,295,350.55.


### Prompt 5

Among all transactions where `IMPORTED VODKA` was sold, which vendor has the most transactions? Report the total number of transactions, the number of bottles sold, and the total amount of revenue from these transactions. Rename the columns to make sure there isn't any confusion as to what they mean!

```{python}
# Use a SQL query to find the answer to the above prompt.

sql = """
SELECT vendor, COUNT(*) AS "Number of Transactions", SUM(bottle_qty) AS "Number of Bottles", SUM(total) AS "Total Revenue"
FROM sales
WHERE category_name = 'IMPORTED VODKA'
GROUP BY vendor
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
"""

pd.read_sql_query(sql, engine)
```

**Prompt 5 Answer**: Pernod Ricard USA/Austin Nichols had 42,338 transactions, totalling 403,450 bottles and \$7,880,365.88 in revenue.


### Prompt 6

The reason we sell things is to make money. In sales, the term **markup** means the amount of extra money charged for a product over the cost to make that product. (You can think of the markup as the profit for that product.)

In Iowa, the law states the minimum price at which liquor may be sold.

Calculate the markup (name this `Markup`) that shows the difference between the `btl_price` and the `state_btl_cost`. 

> If you haven't subtracted columns together before, [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7536996/multiplying-two-columns-in-sql-server/7537059) may be helpful.

```{python}
# Use a SQL query to find the answer to the above prompt.

sql = """
SELECT btl_price - state_btl_cost AS "Markup"
FROM sales;
"""

pd.read_sql_query(sql, engine)
```

**Prompt 6 Answer**: 

<img src="./prompt_6_screenshot.png" alt="prompt_6" height="800"/>


### Prompt 7

Calculate the "Percentage Markup" by dividing markup by the state bottle cost. (Rather than the total profit per bottle, this will tell you how much stores are increasing their price over the state minimum.)

After calculating the "Percentage Markup," calculate the average percentage markup per **store**. Which store has the largest average markup, and what is that average markup?

```{python}
# Use a SQL query to find the answer to the above prompt.

sql = """
SELECT store, AVG((btl_price - state_btl_cost) / state_btl_cost) AS "Percentage Markup"
FROM sales
GROUP BY store
ORDER BY "Percentage Markup" DESC;
"""

pd.read_sql_query(sql, engine)
```

**Prompt 7 Answer**: The store with the highest average markup percentage is store 4013, which has an average percentage markup of 52.5471%.


### Prompt 8

Building off of your last query, retrieve the five stores with the highest average markup percentage. Along with the store IDs and average markup percentage, please return the minimum and maximum markup percentage for those stores, as well as the names and addresses of those store.

What are the names of the five stores?

```{python}
# Use a SQL query to find the answer to the above prompt.

sql = """
SELECT sales.store, AVG((sales.btl_price - sales.state_btl_cost) / sales.state_btl_cost) AS "Percentage Markup", stores.name, stores.store_address
FROM sales 
    LEFT JOIN stores
    ON sales.store = stores.store
GROUP BY sales.store, stores.name, stores.store_address
ORDER BY "Percentage Markup" DESC
LIMIT 5;
"""

pd.read_sql_query(sql, engine)
```

**Prompt 8 Answer**: The five stores with the highest markups are Wal-Mart 0841, Wal-Mart 1546, Wal-Mart 1683, Wal-Mart 3394, and Wal-Mart 2935.


### Prompt 9

Which nine counties sell the highest number of bottles of liquor per capita (per person)? Calculate the average bottle size of the bottles of liquor sold by these counties rounded to the nearest first decimal place. Of the nine counties selling the highest number of bottles of liquor per capita, which county sells (on average) the largest bottle size?

**_BONUS FUN_**: This question can (also) be solved with a SQL subquery - that is, a query that queries a query! If you'd like to give this a try, you can read more about it [here](https://www.dofactory.com/sql/subquery). Otherwise, keep an eye out for the solution key!

```{python}
# Use a SQL query to find the answer to the above prompt.

sql_subquery = """
SELECT * FROM
    (SELECT counties.county, (SUM(bottle_qty) / counties.population) AS "Bottles Sold per Capita", ROUND(AVG(products.bottle_size),1) AS "Average Bottle Size"
    FROM counties
        LEFT JOIN sales
            LEFT JOIN products
            ON sales.item = products.item_no
        ON counties.county = sales.county
    GROUP BY counties.county
    ORDER BY "Bottles Sold per Capita" DESC
    LIMIT 9) as df
ORDER BY "Average Bottle Size" DESC
LIMIT 1;
"""

sql = """
SELECT counties.county, (SUM(bottle_qty) / counties.population) AS "Bottles Sold per Capita", ROUND(AVG(products.bottle_size),1) AS "Average Bottle Size"
FROM counties
    LEFT JOIN sales
        LEFT JOIN products
        ON sales.item = products.item_no
    ON counties.county = sales.county
GROUP BY counties.county
ORDER BY "Bottles Sold per Capita" DESC
LIMIT 9
"""

pd.read_sql_query(sql, engine)
```

**Prompt 9 Answer**: Kossuth County sells the largest average bottle size (among the nine counties selling the most liquor bottles per capita), with an average bottle size of 1041.0 milliliters.


### Prompt 10 (advanced but required!)

In the `sales` table, three columns are `btl_price`, `bottle_qty`, and `total`. The `total` for a transaction _should be_ the product of `btl_price` and `bottle_qty`. How many transactions have a value of `total` that is not equal to `btl_price` time `bottle_qty`?

> There will be a type error as well! We cannot compare type `money` to type `real`. We have to convert `total` to type `money` so that we can compare the two directly. [This link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/cast-and-convert-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15#syntax) may be helpful to you!

```{python}
# Use a SQL query to find the answer to the above prompt.

sql = """
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM sales
WHERE CAST(total AS money) <> (btl_price * bottle_qty);
"""

pd.read_sql_query(sql, engine)
```

**Prompt 10 Answer**: There are no records where `total` is not equal to `btl_price * bottle_qty`.
